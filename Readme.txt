ARAB QWERTY KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR WINDOWS

This keyboard layout has been designed specifically for those
users of our Urdu QWERTY Keyboard Layout who also need to type 
large amounts of Arabic text. Some letters (namely, "kaf", 
"heh", "teh marbuta", and "yeh") have different Unicodes in Urdu 
and Arabic, and have therefore been assigned different keys.  
On the Urdu QWERTY Keyboard Layout, those four letters can be 
typed for Urdu text without pressing the Right-ALT key, but for 
Arabic text, the Right-ALT key has to be held down also. For 
large amount of typing in Arabic, this is inconvenient.  In the 
present Arab QWERTY Keybaord Layout, these letters are typed 
without pressing the Right-ALT key for Arabic and with that 
modifier key held down for Urdu.

Except for the above mentioned difference, this keyboard is 
identical to the Urdu QWERTY Keyboard Layout.  It also includes 
support for Urdu, Persian, Punjabi (Shahmukhi or Pakistani 
style), and Ottoman Turkish. With this layout, you can type all 
the Arabic script characters that these languages use. In 
addition, it also has keys for several mathematical and technical 
symbols.

keyboard map for reference.
